# Min max stack construction
#Write a MinMaxStack class for a min max stack. The class should support:
#   -Pushing and popping values on and off the stack
#   -Peeking at the value at the top of the stack
#   -Getting both the minimum and the maximum values in the stack at any given point in time 

#All class methods, when considered independently should run in constant time and with constant space.

    def peek(self):

    def push(self, number):
